description: A friend and I worked to build a test taking server-side dynamic web app for professors to facilitate exams for their students. I implemented backend APIs to create and store user accounts with MongoDB, while also managing the creation and designation of exams to unique courses. With the student user flow near complete, we are working on developing an easy-to-use grading interface for teaching assistants to score and export student grades.
