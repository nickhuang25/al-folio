description: A passion project for a friend and I, we are working to build an iOS application that centers around optimizing user health and fitness by providing one-month long meal and workout plans. This plan is calculated via an algorithm which outputs unique plans for each user based on a number of body type metrics, current activity, and future goals. I worked mostly on the persistence of user data between life cycles and transfer between different ViewControllers, while also implementing the frontend user flow.
