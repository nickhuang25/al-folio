title: Queens App
description: This project was created in conjunction with a non-profit organization, We Are Queens. This app will serve as a social media interface and personal tracker for participants in the Queens movement to post about their daily GAP reflections. As the Product Manager, I designed the high level structure of the app, as well as built the Storyboard and front-end functionality.
