A little about me - I've just wrapped up a B.S.E in Computer Science at the University of Michigan, and I'm really excited to be returning for a M.S.E. in Computer Science Engineering. My professional interest lies in tying business and technology together, which has led me to join several business organizations on campus and pick up a minor in Business. As someone with a technical background, I always feel closer to my projects when I can rationalize the underlying market strategy or consumer need. As such, I love working on teams where I can play a dual role of developer and PM.

I've worked in a variety of roles in the tech sphere and have been extremely fortunate to work on many different kinds of products. My most recent exploits include interning at Palantir last summer (and this summer!), conducting ML research on AV terrain navigation, and building the backend architecture of an exam distribution web app. 

Outside of my professional and academic life, I'm a big sports player and fan. I watch Man City whenever I can, play tennis regularly, and really enjoy pickup basketball. I've used downtime from the pandemic to pick up chess and piano again, while also recently investing in a Switch to keep myself occupied.
